  Text Label for player score - Global score of the player which determines their win.

  Roll - Rolls a die; outcome maybe any one of the six face values.
  Hold - Passes turn to next player, also adding the Round score to the Global score.
Text Field -
  Custom Goal - Custom win condition can be set. Default is 25.
  
Rules -
Two players engage and the first player to obtain 25 points based on die rolls wins.
Players can choose to either 'Roll' or 'Hold' on their turns.
If they -
  'Roll' - A die appears with a random face value. This face value gets added to their current score.
           A player may wish to roll any number of times, current score is cumulatively increased.
           If however, the player rolls a 1, they lose their accumulated current score and next player's turn begins.
           Similar effect takes place upon two consecutive rolls of 6.
  'Hold' - The current score is added to the global score of the player(just under the 'Player #'.).
           Turn is passed to the next player.
Keep playing till one player reaches the goal score!

Tips -
Don't be greedy, if you have an OK current score 'Hold' or you may lose if you roll a 1 or two consecutive 6(s)!
Your Global score will determine if you win, NOT the current score!
